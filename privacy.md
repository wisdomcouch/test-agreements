For more details on the terms that apply to our Clients’ use of the Quando product.

## Quando’s use of cookies
Quando uses cookies (small text files that Quando stores locally on your computer) to help identify unique visitors and/or devices; assess usage patterns and perform traffic analysis; identify visitor preferences; diagnose problems with our servers, and administer the Quando Service. Quando does not use methods such as browser cache, Flash cookies, or eTags, for acquiring or storing information about end users web browsing activity on Client websites or otherwise.

Depending on how our Clients use Quando’s Services, information contained in Quando cookies placed on the computers of end users may be linked to Personally Identifiable Information in Quando’ database. This allows our Clients to use the Quando Service to better analyze and measure their users’ interactions with their website and to organize activities by the same user on their website across time.

If you do not wish to have Quando place and use cookies on your computer, you should set your browser preferences to refuse all cookies before accessing Quando. Quando is not responsible for any failure by you or your browser to accurately implement or communicate your browser preferences or settings. In addition, please be aware that even if you configure your browser settings to reject all cookies, your activity on Quando websites may still be recorded by our Service when you log in. However, your rejection of all cookies will prevent Quando from determining whether or not someone using your computer has previously visited the website, i.e., whether or not the visitor is a “unique” visitor.

Please note that if you set your browser to reject cookies, some features of the websites you visit may be unavailable. For more information on rejecting cookies, see your browser's instructions on changing your cookie settings. Additionally, please note that rejecting cookies may also prevent you from opting out of our service because that involves placing an opt-out cookie in your browser.

If you do not elect to set your browser preferences to refuse cookies, you consent to have cookies, including cookies used by Quando, placed on your computer when you visit our website.
