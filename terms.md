Certain portions of this Section 14.4 are deemed a "written agreement for arbitration" pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act. You and Quando agree that we intend that this Section 14.4 satisfies the "writing" requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act.

If any controversy, allegation, or claim arises out of or relates to the Services, the Website, your Plan, or this Agreement, including, but not limited to, claims for indemnification, contribution, or cross-claims in a pending action involving one or more third parties (collectively, a "Dispute"), then either you or Quando may elect to submit the Dispute to be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration before a sole arbitrator in accordance with the then current Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. If an in-person arbitration hearing is required, then it will be conducted in New York; but if the applicable arbitration rules or laws require the arbitration to be conducted in the "metropolitan statistical area" (as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau) where you are a resident at the time the Dispute is submitted to arbitration, Quando shall have the right to elect to proceed to arbitration in such location. All parties to the arbitration will have the right, at their own expense, to be represented by an attorney or other advocate of their choosing. You and Quando will pay the administrative and arbitrator's fees and other costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules; but if applicable arbitration rules or laws require Quando to pay a greater portion or all of such fees and costs in order for this Section 13.4 to be enforceable, then Quando will have the right to elect to pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration.

In arbitration, as with a court, the arbitrator must honor the terms of this Agreement and can award the prevailing party damages and other relief (including attorneys' fees). However, WITH ARBITRATION (i) THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY, (ii) THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS AND ARBITRATION OUTCOME ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY RULES, AND (iii) JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE ARBITRATION OUTCOME IS LIMITED.

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IF YOU OR WE WANT TO ASSERT A DISPUTE AGAINST THE OTHER, THEN YOU OR WE MUST COMMENCE IT WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE DISPUTE ARISES OR IT WILL BE FOREVER BARRED.

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU AGREE THAT NO ARBITRATION SHALL BE JOINED WITH ANY OTHER; THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE ARBITRATED ON A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS-ACTION BASIS OR TO UTILIZE CLASS ACTION PROCEDURES; AND THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC OR ANY OTHER PERSONS.

## 12.5. Injunctive Relief
The foregoing provisions of this Section 13.4 will not apply to any (i) legal action taken by you or Quando to seek an injunction or other equitable relief, or (ii) controversy, allegation or claim that arises out of relates to your or Quando's actual or alleged intellectual property rights.

In the event of any conflicts between foreign law, rules, and regulations; and New York law, rules, and regulations, New York law, rules and regulations shall prevail and govern. Except to the extent that arbitration is elected in accordance with Section 13.4 above, any action or proceeding relating to a Dispute may only be instituted in state or federal court in New York. Accordingly, each party agrees to submit to the exclusive and personal jurisdiction of the courts located in New York.
